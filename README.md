gbXMLValidator
==============

Phase 2 gbXML Validator - the Generalizer

This code is designed to check the contents of any gbXML file and report on the validity of its contents to the end user.

It relies written in C#, and has several dependencies on other Open Source libraries that I have written.

VectorMath.dll - a code base for basic vector operations in C# that you can learn more about here

DOEgbXML.dll - a code base for basic gbXML parse routines, which I wrote on behalf of PNNL and the DOE

Read the wiki to learn a lot more about this project and how it has been designed.
