gbXMLValidator
==============

Phase 2 gbXML Validator - the Generalizer

This code is designed to check the contents of any gbXML file and report on the validity of its contents to the end user.

It is the first time an open-source validator like this has been written in any computer language 

The base code is written in C#, and has several dependencies on other C# Open Source libraries that I have written.

VectorMath.dll - a code base for basic vector operations in C# that you can learn more about by looking at my github repo.

DOEgbXML.dll - a code base for basic gbXML parse routines, which I wrote on behalf of PNNL and the DOE.  This is also in the repo.

Read the wiki to learn more about this project and how it has been designed.
